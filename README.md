## New Menu Options

### Create Exlamation / Investigation

- This menu option is available to all players and lets them create a new exclamation or question mark RP descriptor.
- It opens up the text editor and then immediately lets them place the scene descriptor into the world.

### Investigate Scene

- This option is a shortcut and more immersive title for the act of "reading" a roleplay descriptor.
- It exists both on the item as well as in-world, so players do not have to go into the inventory to read a descriptor but can do so by just right-clicking in-world.

### Scene Options

- Roleplay Descriptors can be deleted easily through a menu option.
- For editing a descriptor, it forces it to be picked up into the player's inventory first, to work around the PZ bug where in-world changes to notebooks/descriptors are not properly saved.

## New Popups

### Scene Popup

- Roleplay Descriptors will now display their title as a popup message above your character once the character is close enough and facing towards it.
-This makes it easy to determine what a descriptor is in regards to without having to first "read"/investigate the scene.
