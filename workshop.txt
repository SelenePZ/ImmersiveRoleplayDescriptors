description=[b]This mod requires [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2897228813]Roleplay Descriptors[/url] in order to function![/b]

description=[h1]New Menu Options[/h1]
description=
description=[b]Create Exlamation / Investigation[/b]
description=[list]
description=    [*] This menu option is available to all players and lets them create a new exclamation or question mark RP descriptor.
description=    [*] It opens up the text editor and then immediately lets them place the scene descriptor into the world.

description=
description=[b]Investigate Scene[/b]
description=[list]
description=    [*] This option is a shortcut and more immersive title for the act of "reading" a roleplay descriptor.
description=    [*] It exists both on the item as well as in-world, so players do not have to go into the inventory to read a descriptor but can do so by just right-clicking in-world.

description=[b]Scene Options[/b]
description=[list]
description=    [*] Roleplay Descriptors can be deleted easily through a menu option.
description=    [*] For editing a descriptor, it forces it to be picked up into the player's inventory first, to work around the PZ bug where in-world changes to notebooks/descriptors are not properly saved.

description=
description=[h1]New Popups[/h1]
description=
description=[b]Scene Popup[/b]
description=[list]
description=    [*] Roleplay Descriptors will now display their title as a popup message above your character once the character is close enough and facing towards it.
description=    [*] This makes it easy to determine what a descriptor is in regards to without having to first "read"/investigate the scene.
